        The Taj Mahal is celebrated for its exquisite Mughal architecture. The
        main mausoleum is built entirely of white marble and features intricate
        carvings, delicate inlays of semi-precious stones, and impressive domes.
        The symmetry and precision in its design showcase the skilled
        craftsmanship of the artisans from the Mughal era. The architectural
        beauty of the Taj Mahal has earned it a place among the New Seven
        Wonders of the World.

        The Taj Mahal was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a
        mausoleum for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth.
        The monument is a testament to the enduring love Shah Jahan had for his
        wife. The story behind its construction adds a romantic and emotional
        dimension to the Taj Mahal, making it not only a marvel of architecture
        but also a symbol of eternal love.

        greenery and pathways. The garden is divided into quadrants, and in the
        center lies a large reflecting pool that perfectly mirrors the grandeur
        of the main structure. The reflection in the pool enhances the visual
        impact of the Taj Mahal and adds to its overall charm. The gardens and
        the reflecting pool contribute to the serene and picturesque ambiance of
